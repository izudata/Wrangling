## R Markdown
 
To use external files such as the ones in the dslabs database, one needs to download and install the dslabs package using the command: install.packages("dslabs")

After installing the package, you may assign it to an object, for example: path

path <- system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs")

To view the list of files in the dslabs use: list.files(path)
 
 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
